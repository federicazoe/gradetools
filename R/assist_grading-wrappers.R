#'     The student identifier has to be present somewhere in the file path
#' @param example_feedback_path string; file path to one of the assignment feedback files that will be generated as the user grades. 
#'     This file path structure will be used to determine where the other feedback files will be stored.

#'     This needs to be present somewhere in the example_assignment_path. The student_identifier needs to be the GitHub user name if the user wishes to push issues or feedback to GitHub later
#' @param example_team_identifier string; Used instead of example_student_identifier when grading team assignments with assist_team_grading(). 
#'     A team identifier (e.g. "team1", "team2", etc.) that is used to identify what team the student on the roster is in. 
#'     This needs to be present somewhere in the example_assignment_path.
